## Interactive Window App

The Interactive Window App is an art motion application that displays time and weather data in a graphical format. It operates in two main modes:

1. **Text Mode**: Displays the date, time, weather, temperature, and humidity information in a text-based format. The layout dynamically changes from time to time.

2. **Animation Mode**: Graphically animates the date, time, and weather information. The animations and color changes offer a comfortable view of the passage of time.

The application works in conjunction with the Interactive Window Controller, enhancing its functionality and user experience.

## Interactive Window Controller

The Interactive Window Controller is a companion application designed to act as a remote controller for SONY BRAVIA TV. This remote control app connects to a smart TV via a wireless LAN (Wifi), allowing users to interact with their TV and the Interactive Window App when both devices are connected to the same wireless LAN (Wifi).
