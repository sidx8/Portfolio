# Validator_regex

Validator is a Dart package that provides simple and convenient methods to validate common input data such as emails, URLs, and IP addresses. This package can be particularly useful in situations where you need to validate user input in your Flutter application.

## Features

- Email validation: Checks whether a given string matches the standard format for an email address.
- URL validation: Determines whether a given string is a well-formed URL.
- IP Address validation: Validates that a string is a correctly formatted IP address, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 formats.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter: For installing Flutter and setting up the Dart SDK, follow the instructions provided on the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/).
- Dart: Ensure you have the Dart SDK installed and setup. If you have installed Flutter, Dart should already be installed.

### Installation

Add `validator` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  validator: ^latest_version
```

Then, run

```bash
flutter pub get
```

to fetch the package.

## Usage

You can use the methods provided by the Validator class to validate emails, URLs, and IP addresses:

```dart
import 'package:validator/validator.dart';

// For Email
bool isEmailValid = Validator.email('test@test.com');

// For URL
bool isUrlValid = Validator.url('https://www.test.com');

// For IP Address
bool isIpValid = Validator.ipAddress('192.168.1.1'); //IPv4

```
